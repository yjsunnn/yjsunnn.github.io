<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), supervised by [Prof. Lei Zhang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. from Harbin Institute of Technology and my M.Sc. from Peking University.

### Research Interests
- **Low-level computer vision**. A major challenge in super-resolution is the uncontrollable artifacts stemming from its intrinsically ill-posed nature. I am particularly interested in how to exploit ***multi-frame information*** to generate higher-quality and controllable outputs from degraded inputs.  
- **Computational Imaging**.I view imaging as a transformation from natural, continuous signals to discrete digital measurements. My focus is on ***how we sample the continuous world*** so that the resulting discrete data still permits faithful reconstruction of the underlying scene. Rethinking the sensing stage in this way can fundamentally reshape downstream processing pipelines such as super-resolution.
